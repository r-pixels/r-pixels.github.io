	<p><br>I don't have enough time to say the things I wanna say to do the things I wanna do or to be like you I just want some time to express the things I feel just to express the things I feel and believe them too; 2+2 has been 4 for so many darn years, oh Lord I wanna write a song; oh, baby is that so wrong? And it goes La de da de da de da de day oh La de da de where did all the good times go? La de da de la da dee dum dom, la da de day When will you come back home?</br>
	
	<br>I went down to the mall, then they closed down the mall. Guess they don't want me going to the mall, 'cause I'm just too small (...too small for the mall). Then I built some trains and I'm travelling somewhere new. It's a wonderful world, but still no you; it's a wonderful world for two.</br>
	
	<br>Singin' La de da de da de da de day oh La de da de where did all the bad times roll? I said La de da de la da dee dum dom, la da de day When can you come back home?</br>
	
	<br>I just went online to explain the things I feel, to express the things I mean, and it felt so real. Now I'm doing alright and I'm downright feeling okay. It's the end of the world and I just can't wait; I know that you can relate.</br>
	
	<br>La de da de da de da de day oh La de da de where did all the good times go? I said La de da d-de dum de da, d-d-dim Dwaayah d-de dum dwee ayy, That's okay. La de da de da de da, de day way oh, be dot do When did all the windmills start to turn so slow? Wondering: La de da de la d-de dum dom, la da de day, When will you come back home?</br>
	
	<br>Just got home, got no home... La de da d-de where did it go? Oh no, I can't go home :/</br></p>
